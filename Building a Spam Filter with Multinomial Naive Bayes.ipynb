    "# Building a Spam Filter with Multinomial Naive Bayes\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this project is to build a spam filter for SMS messages using the multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm. The goal is to write a program that classifies new messages with an accuracy greater than 80% — so we expect that more than 80% of the new messages will be classified correctly as spam or ham (non-spam).\n",
    "\n",
    "To train the algorithm, we'll use a dataset of 5,572 SMS messages that are already classified by humans. The dataset was put together by Tiago A. Almeida and José María Gómez Hidalgo, and it can be downloaded from the [The UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/sms+spam+collection). The data collection process is described in more details on [this page](http://www.dt.fee.unicamp.br/~tiago/smsspamcollection/#composition), where you can also find some of the papers authored by Tiago A. Almeida and José María Gómez Hidalgo."

    "* In very rare occasions, ham messages can be incorrectly detected as spam when they are very short (considering also that some of the words from a new message can be absent in the vocabulary) and, at the same time, contain suspicious ad-style words, like unlimited, phone, calls, messages, contact, sent, that were previously found mostly in spam messages and that we observed, indeed, earlier on the word cloud. In addition, false spam messages, being very short, can contain seemingly neutral words (like July) but which were found in the training set only 1-2 times and, by coincidence, in spam messages.\n",
    "* Spam messages incorrectly detected as ham tend to be rather long and have a high percentage of \"normal\" words, which allows them to override the system. They usually contain contact details, websites, mentioning sums of money, words like asap, or they just can, in case of being short, consist of the words absent in the vocabulary.\n",
    "* The message that was not identified at all (and originally it was a ham message) is quite long and characterized by heavy usage of slang and abbreviations most probably absent in the vocabulary. As for the other words, the majority of them look neutral and could have been detected both in spam and ham messages. There are, though, some potentially suspicious words (saved, boost, secret, energy, instantly) that increased the probability of spam for this message up to being equal to that of ham."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we created a highly accurate spam filter based on the multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm and a dataset of labeled 5,572 SMS. The spam filter takes in a new message and classifies it as spam or ham. We managed to reach an accuracy of 98.74%, which is almost 20% higher than our initial focus. Below are some additional conclusions and insights from this project:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A few messages classified incorrectly have some features in common. False spam messages tend to be very short, have the words absent in the vocabulary, contain typical spam-like words, or neutral words previously detected, by coincidence, only in spam messages. False ham messages tend to be rather long and have a high percentage of neutral words or the words absent in the vocabulary. In the undefined messages, we can expect an approximately proportional mixture of neutral and spam-like words.\n",
    "* The attempt to increase the accuracy even further by making the algorithm sensitive to letter case resulted, just the opposite, in rendering the spam filter much less efficient, with the accuracy dropped by 13.5%. It seems that the letter case doesn't make any valuable difference when it comes to distinguishing between spam and ham messages.\n",
    "* The 100 most popular meaningful spam-prone words revealed the following patterns: encouraging people to do further actions, promising them something alluring, urging them, having sexual context, inviting to visit some web resources, advertising various digital devices and products."
