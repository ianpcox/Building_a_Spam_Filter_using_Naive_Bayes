# Building_a_Spam_Filter_using_Naive_Bayes
Using Conditional Probability, the goal of this project was to construct a multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm to handle classification of new messages with an expected accuracy of 80%.  The model exceeded expectation by classifying new messages with an accuracy of ~86%.
